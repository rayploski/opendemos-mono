            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <h2>Who is allowed to attend these demos?</h2>
            <p>Anyone! The original goal of these are to provide a way for Red Hat employees to provide demonstrations of our software for their customers. However there is no reason why partners, internal employees, ISV accounts or anyone else should not join these presentations. In fact, the more the merrier.</p>

            <h2>What is the difference between these and our regularly scheduled webinars presented by our marketing department?</h2>
            <p>These demonstrations feature no marketing information. They are purely designed to show the meat of the product, how it functions and to demonstrate common use cases. Webinars typically have a specific agenda and are generally half presentation, half demonstration. We are giving 100% demonstration for customers who are needing to see a product in action to better understand how to utilize it.</p>

            <h2>Why not simply record a singular session and pass it to customers as a recorded presentation instead of doing a similar demo each week?</h2>
            <p>We have tried this in the past and people still request that live demo. By having an interactive presence on the call, customers receive the attention that they need while also gaining the ability to ask questions and steer the direction of the presentation based on live feedback.</p>

            <h2>The demo is over, now what?</h2>
            <p>If you have additional questions, please contact your account manager or Solution Architect. If you do not know, feel free to email the presenter and they can help you.</p>

            <h2>What does TBA mean?</h2>
            <p>TBA = To Be Announced. There is currently no assigned person to present on that date yet.</p>
